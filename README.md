# Value Plots

Value Plots is a helper utility (and a future library) designed to visualize sensor data from an ESP32 microcontroller's serial monitor. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for displaying and analyzing the sensor data in real-time.

## Features
- A helper project (future library) to plot sensor data from esp32's serial monitor.
- Using [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) as GUI library to display data.
- Simply uses basic string parsing from serial monitor to get sensor data.

## Todo:
- [ ] convert to full library, to be used in multiple projects.
- [ ] research better way to extract data from esp32.
